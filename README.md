# Mental_Fitness_Tracker
In this project I use random forest regressor to predict an individual’s “mental fitness rate”. This approach combines the capabilities of machine learning and regression analysis to assess and quantify one’s mental well-being. By leveraging data and features, the algorithm can generate predictions that shed light on an individual’s mental fitness.
